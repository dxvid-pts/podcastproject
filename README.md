# Podcastproject

This is the source code of my multi-article case study in which I created a fully-fledged podcast app with flutter. </br>
The articles can be found here: https://www.peterscode.dev/go/podcast-project </br></br>
The App is available on the Google Play Store and on the App Store.</br>
