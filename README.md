>Note: The app is dependent on two pull requests([New Button Universe #59702](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/59702), [[Material] Updated icons and fonts #61778](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/61778)), which are only available on the master channel and thus not compilable if you are on stable.
